Factorial.java The “classic” recursive demo. The Factorial function can be described as n! = n * (n – 1) * (n – 2)… * 2 * 1 We can also describe it with the following recursive definition n! = n * (n – 1)!, where n! = 1 for n = 1. Thisprogram calculates n! with a recursive method. It also provides a non-recrusive solution for comparison purposes. The recursive form. Note the terminating condition and the recursive call. the non-recrusive form
